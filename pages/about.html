<h1>About GoMyCode</h1>
<body>
    <p>GOMYCODE was founded in 2017 on the premises of our passion for digital and the observation that the gap between the traditional training offered and the job offers available needed to be bridged. We have built a real community around digital technology and we are proud to be pioneers in this field.

    <p>GOMYCODE opened its doors in a coworking space. Shortly after, GOMYCODE won the BlooMMasters program in MIT (in 2017) and opened its first hackerspace in Tunis before expanding its presence in Sousse and Sfax. During its first 3 years, GOMYCODE trained more than 5,000 students and established partnerships with more than 100 organizations between private and public companies, universities and non-governmental organizations.
