            <h2>Meridith Elliott Powell</h2>
            <p>
                First on our list is the one and only Meridith Elliott Powell. 
                As both an experienced saleswoman and a decorated speaker, Meridith’s 
                speaking business can serve as an example in many regards. However, 
                in the context of her speaker bio, there are a few things that make 
                it especially noteworthy. First, it highlights her accomplishments 
                in her field and as a speaker right from the beginning. This shows 
                her confidence as well as her experience, making her a valuable hire 
                for any event organizer reading her bio. Second, she names the industries 
                for which her content is designed, specifically “banking, healthcare, 
                and finance”. In this way, she clears up any confusion the reader may 
                have as to whether or not she’s a good fit for their organization. 
                She also saves herself from having to meet with event organizers that 
                turn out to be a bad fit for her message.
